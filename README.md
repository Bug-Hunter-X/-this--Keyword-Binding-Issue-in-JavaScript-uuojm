# JavaScript 'this' Keyword Binding Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to the unexpected behavior of the `this` keyword.  The `bug.js` file shows a function where `this` does not refer to the intended object, resulting in unexpected output.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution using `bind`, `arrow functions`, or other methods to correctly bind `this`.

## Bug Description

In JavaScript, the value of `this` depends on how a function is called.  If a function is called directly, `this` often refers to the global object (window in browsers). This can lead to unexpected behavior if the function is intended to operate within a specific object's context.

## Solution

Several approaches can fix this issue:

* **`bind()` method:**  The `bind()` method creates a new function with `this` permanently bound to a specific value.
* **Arrow functions:** Arrow functions lexically bind `this`, meaning `this` refers to the surrounding scope.
* **Explicitly setting `this`:**  Inside the function, you can assign `this` to a variable, ensuring that you are using the correct context.
